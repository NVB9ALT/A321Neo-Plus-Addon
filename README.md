Note, this is a pre release and is subject to change at any moment. Much of what is seen here is not a final product.

Old versions of this plugin are NOT COMPATIBLE with low-end devices. Those versions are reliant on a minimum refresh rate of 30 fps, as this is the refresh rate of the fly by wire system. For best results, use the latest revision.

How To Run:
Note: In order to use this plugin, you must have access to the chrome devtools or the bookmarklet console (available on my GitHub repositories page).

Copy the contents of A321neo.js into the chrome console. you can access it with CTRL+SHIFT+C or F12.

Execute the code with enter or clicking "Execute".

You do not need to download the files to your computer. Trying to run the file on node.js will result in errors.

CHANGELOGS:
Version Pre-Release 1:
First Iteration of the plugin. Had severe FBW issues.

Version Pre Release 1.1:
Second Iteration, new FBW rules to make ground handling easier, minor rewrite of some of the FBW systems to prevent control fighting.
